    <p>Hello, my name is Trevor but online I go by trevor_ow. Me being uncreative could not think of a whittier online alias.
        I currently am unemployed, but previously worked at CVS as a cashier for 3 years followed by another year and a half 
        as a Supervisor. The name trevor_ow comes from my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/trevor_ow">twitch</a> username. I streamed (with no real growth)
        for around 3 years. The goal was never to become a huge streamer but if it happened while I was just havin a good
        time playing games then I would not complain. Hobbies for me primarily include video games. Recently I became obsessed with Apex Legends. 
        Previous to that I had solely played Overwatch. In my prime I was a steady low master/high diamond off-tank. If I had to pick a hero 
        that would one-trick it will be RoadHog everytime. Nothing is more satisfying than hitting that clutch hook on a flanking tracer/genji.
        Furthermore, I would like to expand my knowledge in web development and maintain that as my career path.
    </p>
