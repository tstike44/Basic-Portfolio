            <h2 id="bio">About Me</h2>
            <p id="para-bio">Hello, my name is Trevor but online I go by trevor_ow. Me being uncreative could not think
                of a
                wittier
                online alias.
                I currently am unemployed, but previously worked at CVS as a cashier for 3 years followed by another
                year
                and a half
                as a Supervisor. The name trevor_ow comes from my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/trevor_ow"
                    target="_blank">twitch</a>
                username. I have been streaming (with no real growth)
                for around 3 years. The goal was never to become a huge streamer but if it happened while just having
                fun in
                my free time
                then I would not complain. Hobbies for me primarily include video games. Recently I
                became obsessed with Apex Legends.
                Previous to that I had solely played Overwatch. In my prime I was a steady low master/high diamond
                off-tank.
                If I had to pick a hero
                that would one-trick it will be RoadHog everytime. Nothing is more satisfying than hitting that clutch
                hook
                on a flanking tracer/genji.
                Furthermore, I would like to expand my knowledge in web development and maintain that as my career path.
